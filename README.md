# Atlas: My React Native Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository serves as a personal playground and learning hub for my journey into React Native development. As I tackle daily tasks and explore new concepts, this project will evolve into a comprehensive application showcasing my progress and understanding.

## About The Project

The primary goal of this project is to learn and implement various features of React Native. Each new task, component, or screen I build will be integrated into the application's navigation, creating a living portfolio of my skills. This approach allows for hands-on experience and a practical way to track my learning.

### Key Learning Areas:

  * **React Navigation:** Implementing and managing different navigation patterns (stack, tab, drawer).
  * **Component Development:** Creating reusable and functional UI components.
  * **State Management:** Exploring different state management solutions (e.g., Context API, Redux).
  * **API Integration:** Fetching and displaying data from external APIs.
  * **UI/UX Design:** Styling components and creating an intuitive user experience.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and the React Native CLI set up on your development machine. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) documentation.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Hamza-ali1223/Atlas.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**

    cd Atlas
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

  * **For Android:**
    ```sh
    npx react-native run-android
    ```
  * **For iOS:**
    ```sh
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard bare React Native structure. As I add new features, the following directories will be populated:

```
Atlas/
â”œâ”€â”€ android/
â”œâ”€â”€ ios/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/   # Navigation setup and configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens/      # Application screens corresponding to different tasks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/       # Images, fonts, and other static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

This structure helps in keeping the codebase organized and scalable as more features are added.
